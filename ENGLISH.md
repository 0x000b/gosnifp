## Installation

If you want all the project files, make sure you have `Go` installed and simply `clone` the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x000b/gosnifp.git
cd gosnifp/
```
In the folder, `run`:
```bash
go build cmd/gosnifp/main.go
```
Once you have obtained the binary file, just use `sudo` to allow the sniffer to read your interface:
```bash
sudo ./gosnifp [INTERFACE]
```

## Diagram

The diagram tries to represent the basic functioning of the sniffer. Incoming DNS packets pass through two main processes: Sniffer and Preprocessor. The `Sniffer` is actually the part of the software that actively captures packets on the network and sends them for processing. The `Preprocessor` is responsible for capturing the important data from the packet, creating an object relating to the packet and sending it to the monitors (`Monitor Logging`) and loggers who will create the `Log` files.
